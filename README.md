# TinyNetwork
This is an example of how to use Chris Eidof's [Tiny Networking Library] (https://gist.github.com/chriseidhof/26bda788f13b3e8a279c#file-tiny-networking-swift) and his [type-safe routes](https://gist.github.com/chriseidhof/1fc977ffb856dbcdc113).

The goal for this project is to be able to write unit tests for the code.
