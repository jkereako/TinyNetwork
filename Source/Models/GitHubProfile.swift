// This let's us save JSON, which is represented as a `[String: AnyObject]` dictionary, as a type.
// If we were to use this this with Core Data, then to build the Core Data object would be as simple
// as passing in a `GitHubProfile` instance into the Core Data class `init` method. Because all of
// the properties of `GitHubProfile` are not optional, we can guarantee that the values will always
// exist.
